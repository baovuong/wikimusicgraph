"I suspect the following statement may piss off dance nerds, but it’s fair to say that Knuckles had as much claim as anyone to having ‘invented’ house music thirty odd years ago.

[...] They called this sound Warehouse music. For short, house music." 2014-04-01 (re-issue of a November 1987 article).
